# FHCircleView


FHCircleView displays just a flat circle in a configureable color. I needed a view like this and it took my quite some time since I'm new to Core Graphics. Since it's so simple and I didn't find anything that did exactly what I wanted I thought I might share it. Check out my [blog post](http://s.flohei.de/y) for more information.

`FHCircleViewExample.m` shows how to use the FHCircleView.

Feel free to use it in your own projects.
